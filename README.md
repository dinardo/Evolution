# Evolution

Describe the dynamics of the spread of a disease among a population, in particular the development of infected active cases

Basic assumptions:
- the disease can be spread to other individuals from the infected ones
- the infected individuals can recover (either survive or die)
- the system is closed (no "natural" demographic change)
- recovered individuals can not become re-infected
